# ConsoleChat :speech_balloon:
An opensource global chatroom that 100% changable and moddable!

The client is very light weight for the user. It doesn't have lots of code either. The magic simply happens on the [Server]() side. Everyone can host a what we call *"community server"*, it's simply a server that people host on their machine and will come up inside the server browser. The modding and custom commands, minigames ect then happens on these servers maid by modders. The code is 100% open source for both the server and the client if you want to check it out for yourself. This project is under the [MIT](https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT) license.

### Install the client :raised_hands:
The client is easy to install if you follow these steps:
1. Install NodeJS if you haven't done so...
2. [Download]() the files to your local machine and extract it.
3. Edit the "config.json" file and change your username to the name you want to display on the servers. You don't have to set an ID, we will do that for you!
4. Open a command prompt and locate the folder that you extracted it to.
5. Inside the console type "node index.js" and it should start correctly, if having any type of problems we are glad to help if you open an [issue](https://github.com/ThunbergOlle/ConsoleChat/issues/new)

You are setup! Now there should be a small server list showing up! Lovely! :heart:

### Chatrooms :herb:
Every chat room is global. That means that everyone can join it at anytime anonymously. The servers that exists shows up at the server list inside the server browser that you will face when starting the file. :thought_balloon:

**Kicking** :boom:

Yes, you can be kicked from chatrooms by administrators if you don't behave good. 

**Commands** :star:

You can see the commands by typing:

    /help

**Prefixes** :fire:

For admins there are prefixes by default so you will be able to see if someone is admin or not. Admins are added manualy by the id. More information on how you can add an admin to your server can be found [here]().

Inside the config.json file you will find 3 things to change. 
- username: The username that you want to chat with
- id: Leave this blank. The script will auto generate an id for you.
- mainserver: The server IP that you want to use as the main server, don't change this.
