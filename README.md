# ConsoleChat :speech_balloon:
An opensource global chatroom that 100% changable and moddable!

The client is very light weight for the user. It doesn't have lots of code either. The magic simply happens on the [Server]() side. Everyone can host a what we call *"community server"*, it's simply a server that people host on their machine and will come up inside the server browser. The modding and custom commands, minigames ect then happens on these servers maid by modders. The code is 100% open source for both the server and the client if you want to check it out for yourself. This project is under the [MIT](https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT) license.

### Install the client :raised_hands:
The client is easy to install if you follow these steps:
1. Install NodeJS if you haven't done so...
2. [Download]() the files to your local machine and extract it.
3. Edit the "config.json" file and change your username to the name you want to display on the servers. You don't have to set an ID, we will do that for you!
4. Open a command prompt and locate the folder that you extracted it to.
5. Inside the console type "node index.js" and it should start correctly, if having any type of problems we are glad to help if you open an [issue](https://github.com/ThunbergOlle/ConsoleChat/issues/new)

You are setup! Now there should be a small server list showing up! Lovely! :heart:
